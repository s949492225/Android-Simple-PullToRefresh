# Simple Pull To Refresh for Android

**SimplePullToRefresh** is an Android library containing **PullToRefreshLayout** which provides a simple pull-to-refresh function.  
I started this project because other pull-to-refresh libraries I tried didn't work well with the [CoordinatorLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.html).

Supports SDK version 14 and above.  

This should work with any views including the [CoordinatorLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.html). If there are any problems with certain views please let me know.

## Samples
You can try the sample app from Google Play:

## Usage
Please read the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/skhugh/Android-SimplePullToRefresh/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) page.

## Customization
I tried to keep things simple for this project, but there are still some customization options available.  

You can learn about these options at [Customization](https://github.com/skhugh/Android-SimplePullToRefresh/wiki/Customization) page.

## Advanced Customization
There is also a way to fully customize the refresh icon.

## Acknowledgement
This module uses [Material-ish Progress](https://github.com/pnikosis/materialish-progress) for the refresh icon.
